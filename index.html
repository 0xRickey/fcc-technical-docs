				<header>Conditional Statements</header>
				<p>
					In Java, controlling the flow of your program is vital, and this is achieved using conditional statements like <b> if, else if, and else. </b>
					The if statement evaluates a condition, executing its block of code when true. If additional conditions need checking, the else if comes into 
					play, only being evaluated if previous conditions are false. The else clause serves as a catch-all, executing its block when no prior 
					conditions hold true. Together, these statements offer a structured and intuitive approach to decision-making in your Java programs.
				</p>
				<h3>Examples</h3>
				
				<p>If statement:</p>
				<code>
					int age = 25; <br/>
					if (age >= 18) { <br/>
						&emsp; System.out.println("You are an adult."); <br/>
					}
				</code>
				
				<p>Else statement:</p>
				<code>
					int temperature = 28; <br/>
					if (temperature > 30) { <br/>
						&emsp; System.out.println("It's hot outside."); <br/>
					} else { <br/>
						&emsp; System.out.println("It's not too hot."); <br/>
					}
				</code>

				<p>Else-if</p>
				<code>
					int score = 75; <br/>
					if (score >= 90) { <br/>
						&emsp;	System.out.println("You got an A."); <br/>
					} else if (score >= 80) { <br/>
						&emsp;	System.out.println("You got a B."); <br/>
					} else if (score >= 70) { <br/>
						&emsp;	System.out.println("You got a C."); <br/>
					} else { <br/>
						&emsp;	System.out.println("You need to improve your score."); <br/>
					}

				<header>Arrays</header>
				<p>
					In Java, an array is a fundamental data structure that allows you to store a collection of elements of the same data type under a single variable name. 
					Arrays provide a way to efficiently manage and access multiple values of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. Each element in an array is 
					accessed using an index, which starts from 0 for the first element and increments by one for each subsequent element. Arrays are particularly useful 
					when you need to work with a fixed number of elements and want to access them using their positions within the collection.
				</p>

				<h3>Declaration</h3>
				<p>
					To declare an array in Java, you need to specify the data type of the elements it will hold, followed by the array variable name and square brackets. 
					The general syntax for declaring an array is:
				</p>
				<code>
					dataType[] arrayName; <br>
					// For example to declare an array that holds integers <br>
					int[] numbers;
				</code>

				<h3>Initialisation</h3>
				<p>There are a few ways to initialize an array in Java. 
					One common way is to specify the size of the array and assign values to its elements using curly braces and commas:
				</p>
				<code>
					int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
				</code>
				<p>You can also initialize an array using the new keyword along with the size of the array:</p>
				<code>
					int[] numbers = new int[5]; // Creates an array of 5 integers
				</code>

				<h3>Array Properties</h3>
				<p>Arrays in Java have a few important properties:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Fixed Size:</b> The size of an array is fixed upon initialization, and it cannot be changed during the program's execution. 
						To accommodate a different number of elements, you would need to create a new array with the desired size.
					</li>

					<li>
						<b>Contiguous Memory:</b> Elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations. This characteristic leads to efficient 
						memory usage and allows for constant-time access to elements using their indices.
					</li>

					<li>
						<b>Homogeneous Elements:</b> Arrays can only hold elements of the same data type. If you need to store different data types, 
						you would typically use arrays of objects or other collection 
					</li>

					<li>
						<b>Zero-Based Indexing:</b> Array indices start from 0. The index of the last element in an array of size n is n - 1.
					</li>

					<li>
						<b>Length Property:</b> Arrays have a built-in length property that gives you the number of elements in the array. 
						It's particularly useful when iterating over array elements.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<header>While Loops</header>
				<p>
					In Java, a while loop is a fundamental control structure that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. 
					It provides a way to automate repetitive tasks, iterating over a sequence of actions until the condition evaluates to false. 
					The while loop is especially useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on dynamic conditions.
				</p>
				<h3>Syntax</h3>
				<code>
				while (condition) { <br>
					&emsp; // Code to be executed repeatedly as long as the condition is true <br>
				}
				</code>
				<h3>Example</h3>
				<code>
					int count = 0; <br>
					while (count 	&lt; 5) { <br>
						&emsp;	System.out.println("Count: " + count); <br>
						&emsp;	count++; // Increment the count for the next iteration <br>
					}
				</code>
			</section>
			<section id="for_loops" class="main-section">
				<header>For Loops</header>
				<p>
					In Java, a for loop is a versatile control structure designed to efficiently execute a block of code repeatedly for a predetermined number of iterations. 
					For loops are particularly useful when you know the exact number of times you want to repeat an action. 
					They provide a compact and structured way to manage loops while maintaining control over initialization, condition checking, and iteration updates.
				</p>
				<h3>Syntax</h3>
				<code>
				for (initialization; condition; update) { <br>
					&emsp; // Code to be executed in each iteration <br>
				}
				</code>
				<h3>Example</h3>
				<code>
				for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) { <br>
					&emsp; System.out.println("Iteration: " + i); <br>
				}
				</code>
				<p>
					In this example, the for loop iterates five times. The loop starts with i being 0, and in each iteration, it checks if i is less than 5. 
					If true, it executes the code block and then increments i by 1. The loop stops when i becomes 5.
